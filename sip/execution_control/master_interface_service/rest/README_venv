These instructions will change.

1) Create a Virtual Environment:
 python3 -m venv venv
2) Activate it:
 . venv/bin/activate
3) upgrade pip:
 pip install --upgrade pip
 This will use the pip in the virtual environment and install to the 
 virtual environment.
4) Install the required packages:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 (gunicorn is not in the requirements file)
5) Install gunicorn
 pip install  gunicorn
6) Install Nijin's config_db package.
  pip install ../../configuration_db/redis

Now you are ready to run the application:
 gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app.app:APP

You don't need to activate the env to run this every time:
 venv/bin/gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app.app:APP
