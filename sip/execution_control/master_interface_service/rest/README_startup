It is assumed you will start this service along with the master controller
service, within Docker containers. To do so you should run the script
start_master_controller_service which is two directories above in 
execution_control.
To stop the services you should use the stop_master_controller_service
script in the same directory.

If you require to run this natively (outside the docker):
You need a python3 installation with the following modules installed:
 - Flask
 - Flask-API
 - redis

This should either be in your system libraries, or you create a python 
virtual environment (venv) and install the modules there.

Assuming you have installed the above modules and (where required)
activated the venv, run the following command in this directory:

    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app.app:APP

Note that some files have to be copied from
../../configuration_db/redis/db_client to app:
  - event_keys.py 
  - events.py 
  - master_client.py 
  - config_db_redis.py

These will be copied automatically if you run the script
start_master_controller_service in (and from) the direcory execution_control.

The util directory contains some shell scripts to test the flask API outside 
of a web interface.
