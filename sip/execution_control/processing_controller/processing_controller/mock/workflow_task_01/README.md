# Mock workflow task: Receive visibilities, variant 01

This is a mock task used to test a simple workflow with the processing
block controller.

This task generates mocks the receive of visibilities, writing the output
to a buffer for use by a 2nd workflow stage which processes the visibility data
"received" by this task.
