# Processing Controller Interface (Tango)

Placeholder folder for service exposing a set of Tango Devices prototyping the Processing Controller Interface to TM.

This should consist of 16 sub-array devices and a processing controller device either all serviced from the same 
Device Server or split into a pair of Device Servers, one for sub-array devices and one for the Processing Controller device.
