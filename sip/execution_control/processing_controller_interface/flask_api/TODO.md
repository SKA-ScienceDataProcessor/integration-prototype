# TODO

- [ ] Subarray devices should only link to real-time processing blocks
      (ie the sub-array goes away for offline processing)
- [ ] Cancel / delete needs to have arguments to remove data or not in case processing is rescheduled
- [ ] Give option to restart a processing block with an updated workflow?
