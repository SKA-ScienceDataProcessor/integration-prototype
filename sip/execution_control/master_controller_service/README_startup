It is assumed you will start this service along with the master interface
service, within Docker containers. To do so you should run the script
start_master_controller_service which is in the ../master_interface_service/rest
directory.
To stop the services you should use the stop_master_controller_service
script in the same directory.

If you require to run this natively (outside the docker) follow the
instructions in the accompanying README_venv file which explains how
to create a python virtual environment and populate it with the required
python packages.
