It is assumed you will start this service along with the master interface
service, within Docker containers. To do so you should run the script
start_master_controller_service which is one directory above in 
execution_control.
To stop the services you should use the stop_master_controller_service
script in the same directory.

If you require to run this natively (outside the docker):
From this directory, run the command:
    python3 -m app

Note that some files have to be copied from
../configuration_db/redis/db_client to app:
  - event_keys.py 
  - events.py 
  - master_client.py 
  - config_db_redis.py

These will be copied automatically if you run the script
start_master_controller_service in (and from) the direcory execution_control.
