You can use the virtual environment created for the master interface service.
But if you want separate venvs do the following:

1) Create a Virtual Environment:
 python3 -m venv venv
2) Activate it:
 . venv/bin/activate
3) upgrade pip:
 pip install --upgrade pip
 This will use the pip in the virtual environment and install to the 
 virtual environment.
4) Install the required packages:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
5) Install Nijin's config_db package.
  pip install ../configuration_db/redis

Now you are ready to run the application:
 python3 -m app

You don't need to activate the env to run this every time:
 venv/bin/python3 -m app
