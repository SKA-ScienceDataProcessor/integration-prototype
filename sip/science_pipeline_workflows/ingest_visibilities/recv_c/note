I think it would be a bit clearer to write this instead, and remove the line above it:

Suggested change 
    vis_ptr = (struct DataType *) scan_ptr;
    struct DataType* vis_ptr = (struct DataType*) (scan_ptr + 1);
The separate declaration of vis_ptr on line 140 is then also not required.

I have to admit a preference to putting all variable declarations at the start of a code block. We may be C programmers, but that doesn't make us anarchists :-)

My motivation for flagging this was because it's logically wrong to increment a variable called scan_ptr, which then makes it no longer point to the scan ID. Code like this is unsafe, as any future use of scan_ptr would then be an error.
