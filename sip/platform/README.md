# SIP Platform

## Description

This package groups libraries and services providing databases, queues, 
logging and metrics, container orchestration, and infrastructure services. 

Have spent considerable time and effort investigating and experimenting with 
interfaces between the platform and SDP operation system. While a lot of this 
effort was focused on the use of Container Orchestration, also experimented 
with logging, monitoring, metrics and alarms services.

More details on each of the libraries is described and how to run them can be 
found in their README files. 
 
The detailed decomposition of this package is described in the architecture [AD01].
